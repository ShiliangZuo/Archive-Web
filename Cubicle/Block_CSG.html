     <p> Block Builder </p>
     <p> A block model is generated for each puzzle of this type.
       A block model has a 3 by 3 grid base,
       where on each grid, up to 5 unit cubes can be stacked.
       The player is then given the 3-view of the model,
       and the goal of the player is to build the 3D model given the 3-view of the model.
       This type of game is aimed at training students’ ability to understand orthographic drawings.
       By asking the students to transform orthographic drawings into 3D models,
       the process should improve the students’ understanding of the relation between a 3D model and its orthographic drawings.

     <p> CSG </p>
     <p>
       CSG stands for Constructive Solid Geometry. CSG techniques allow a modeler to perform boolean operations on 3D objects. A Boolean operation includes: Union, Intersection and Subtraction.
       The gameplay is quite simple. The player is given several primitive objects (e.g., cube, cuboid, sphere, cylinder) and a complex target object generated by the primitive objects by boolean operations. The goal of the player is to find the series of boolean operations that creates the complex target object.
       This type of game is aimed at training students’ ability on manipulating solid objects. Students need to think about what an operation would do to objects in order to complete this task.
